# Eurobank Saves 2M+ in Marketingn Budget with Machine Learning


---

## Business Problem

The European Bank uses telemarketing campaigns to promote their product Bank Term Deposit.  It currently uses a predictive model to help them determine, in advance, clients who will be receptive to such marketing campaigns.  The bank wants to evaluate the current model, it's implications, and determine whether or not the current model should be replaced.

## Purpose


The purpose of this analysis is to help The European Bank to increase efficiency, enhance the customer experience, and reduce costs when executing phone marketing capaigns.

## Overview of Approach

1. Exploratory Data Analysis, Statistical Analysis, and Data Cleanse (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
2. Create New Predictive Models (scikit-learn, Logistic Regression, used resampling techniques to solve class imbalance)
3. Chose the best performing model according to the metrics (accuracy score, f1-score)
4. Naive Random Oversampling technique gave us the best performing model


---

## Executive Summary:


* By replacing the current model the bank will reduce by 68% of the current marketing efforts invested in phone marketing campaigns

* The new predictive model can help the bank to enhance the customer experience by saving  27,250 of the current clients receiving unwanted calls compared to the current model

* Monday and Friday are the least ideal days of the week to generate client conversions compared to the rest of the weekdays.  The best days for contacting clients were Thursday, Tuesday, and Wednesday respectively

* Clients who have converted in previous marketing campaigns might be significantly more receptive to a new marketing campaign 


---

## Conclusions:

* There is a trade-off between customer conversions, the customer experience, and cost savings 

* The current model generates  719 more conversions but it also generates 27,250 of our clients unnecessarily contacted affecting the customer experience and increasing cost

* The new model proposes a more segmented and efficient approach for our marketing campaigns. We can reduce by 68% our efforts and reduce cost, increase our customer experience, and reduce opportunity costs.



---

## Recommendations:

* Prioritize the customer experience and either enhance the current model or replace it by our model that does a better job in predicting clients who will not convert

* Analyze contact center costs and determine the cost savings by having 68% less effort invested from our team in phone marketing campaigns

* Compare the cost reduction generated by less effort against the extra revenue generated by the 719 extra conversions that generates the current model

* Perform a customer survey to measure the perception of the banks’s brand and the customer’s experience when contacted for marketing purposes

* Performing the majority of client calls during Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays respectively. Avoid Mondays and Fridays.

* Prioritize calling clients who subscribed past marketing campaigns in order to increase conversions

* Investigate outliers and unknown data and its causes and explore the possibility of replacing them
